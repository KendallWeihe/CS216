Assignment: CS216 Fall 2016 Project #2 Part I
Requirements:
  - Design 15 test cases for the simple line editor developed in project #1
Purpose:
  - Teach the student how to generate good and all-encompassing test cases

Program specifications (directly copied from specs document):
  • If the letter I is entered with a number n following it, display a prompt “>” along
  with the line number n, after user types a line of text, then insert the text at line n, and
  the original text at line n becomes line n+1. If n is larger than the total number of the
  current lines displayed from the editor, then you need insert a few lines of empty text
  in order to insert the user input text at line n. If the letter I is entered without a
  number following it, display a prompt “>”, after user types a line of text, then insert
  the text at the end of the current text lines. For example, before inserting the new text
  line, the original text lines have m lines, then the new text line becomes line m+1.
  • If D is entered with a number n, then delete line n. If n is not a valid line number,
  then delete nothing.
  • If L is entered, then list all lines of text.
  • If S is entered, then save the current content into the input file (overwrite the old one)
  • If H is entered, then display the instruction menu.
  • (Not covered in these test cases) If C is entered with a number n, then the text line n is
  copied into the clipboard. If is not a valid line number, then copy nothing.
  • (Not covered in these test cases) If P is entered with a number n, then the content in the
  clipboard is inserted at line n. If n is not a valid line number, then paste nothing.
  • If Q is entered, prompt the message for the user to choose “Do you wan to save the
  change? (Y - yes; N - no) If the user enters “Y’, save the text into the original input
  file (overwrite the old one) then quit the program; if the user enters “N”, quit the
  program directly.

General testing outline:
  - Test both successful and unsuccessful cases for each:
    - Text insertion
    - Text deletion
    - Printing the file
    - Saving the file
    - Printing instructions
    - Quitting the program
    - Other erroneous cases

Total number of test cases: 29

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text insertion (user inputs "I"):
  Successful:
    > I
    > This is a line to be inserted
      --> the above line is inserted at the end of the text file

    > I 1
    > This is a line to be inserted
      --> the above line is inserted at the beginning of the text file

    > I 5
    > This is a line to be inserted
      --> the above line is inserted at line number 5

    Given the total number of lines is equal to 5
      > I 10
      > This is a line to be inserted
        --> pad line numbers 6-9 with empty strings and insert the above line at line number 10

  Unsuccessful:
    > II
    Invalid command

    > I L
    Invalid line number

    > I 0
    Invalid line number
      --> line numbers begin at 1

    > I -1
    Invalid line number

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text deletion (user inputs "D"):
  Successful:
    > D 5
      --> line number 5 is deleted

  Unsuccessful:
    > D
    You must specify a line number to delete

    > D D
    Invalid line number

    > D 0
    Invalid line number
      --> line numbers begin at 1

    > D -1
    Invalid line number

    Given the total number of lines is equal to 5
      > D 10
      This line number does not exist

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Printing the file (user inputs "L"):
  Successful:
    > L
    1> the quick
    2> brown
    3>
    4> fox jumps over the lazy
    5> dog

  Unsuccessful:
    > L 2
    Invalid command

    > L abc
    Invalid command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saving the file (user inputs "S"):
    Successful:
      > S
      File saved

    Unsuccessful:
      > S 123
      Invalid command

      > S abc
      Invalid command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Printing the instructions (user inputs "H"):
  Successful:
    > H
    -----------------------------------------------------------
     To insert text at the end of the file, type 'I' then
    press enter.
     To insert text at a certain line number, type 'I'
    followed by a space and the desired line number.
     To delete a line, type 'D' followed by a space and the
    line number.
     To copy a line into clipboard, type 'C' followed by a
    space and the line number.
     To paste a line, type 'P' followed by a space and the
    line number.
     A text line which has been copied into clipboard
    recently is the line to be pasted.
     To print all the lines, type 'L' and press enter.
     To save the current content, type 'S' and press enter.
     To display this introduction, type 'H' and press
    enter.
     To quit, type 'Q' and press enter.
    -----------------------------------------------------------

  Unsuccessful:
    > H 20
    Invalid command

    > H abc
    Invalid command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quitting the program (user inputs "Q"):
  Successful:
    > Q
    Do you want to save the change? (Y-yes; N-no)
    > Y
    Thank you for using myEditor.

  Unsuccessful:
    > Q 0
    Invalid command

    > Q abc
    Invalid command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other erroneous cases:
  > A
  Invalid command

  > Foo bar
  Invalid command

  > 123
  Invalid command
